# Development Safety Guide

## 🎯 Current Branching Strategy

### Branch Structure
```
main (production) ← LIVE on Render - DO NOT TOUCH
├── develop (staging) ← Integration testing
└── feature/safe/profile-upload (current) ← Safe development
```

### Workflow Rules
1. **NEVER push directly to main** while app is in production
2. **Develop and test on feature branches**
3. **Only merge to main after thorough testing**
4. **Production deploys only from main branch**

## 🛡️ Safe Profile Upload Implementation

### What Was Improved
- ✅ **Comprehensive error handling** - No more backend crashes
- ✅ **File validation** - Size, type, and format checks
- ✅ **Rollback mechanism** - Automatically reverts on failure
- ✅ **File cleanup** - Removes orphaned files on error
- ✅ **Transaction safety** - Database consistency maintained
- ✅ **Detailed logging** - Better debugging information
- ✅ **Proper HTTP status codes** - Clear error responses

### Safety Features
1. **Pre-upload validation** - Checks user exists
2. **Multi-step validation** - File type, size, format
3. **Atomic operations** - Either all succeed or all fail
4. **Automatic cleanup** - No orphaned files or data
5. **Error recovery** - Graceful degradation
6. **Health check endpoint** - Test system before use

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Phase 1: Health Check (Current)
```bash
# Test upload system health
GET /api/users/test-upload-health
```

### Phase 2: Local Testing
1. Set up local development environment
2. Test profile uploads locally first
3. Validate all error conditions
4. Confirm no crashes or data corruption

### Phase 3: Staging Testing (Future)
1. Deploy to separate staging environment
2. Test with real files and edge cases
3. Performance and stress testing
4. Security validation

### Phase 4: Production Release
1. Merge to develop branch
2. Final integration testing
3. Merge to main (triggers production deploy)
4. Monitor deployment closely

## 🚨 Emergency Rollback Plan

If production breaks:
1. **Immediately revert to previous main commit**
2. **Force redeploy from known good state**
3. **Fix issues on feature branch**
4. **Re-test before next deployment**

## 📋 Testing Checklist

Before merging to main, ensure:
- [ ] Health check endpoint returns all green
- [ ] Profile upload works with valid files
- [ ] Error handling works with invalid files
- [ ] File size limits are enforced
- [ ] File type validation works
- [ ] Database rollback works on errors
- [ ] No memory leaks or file handle issues
- [ ] Proper cleanup of temporary files
- [ ] CORS still works for all other features
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test the improved upload locally**
2. **Validate all safety features work**
3. **Consider setting up staging environment**
4. **Document any additional edge cases**
5. **Plan production deployment strategy**

## 🔧 Development Commands

```bash
# Current branch status
git branch

# Switch between branches
git checkout develop
git checkout feature/safe/profile-upload
git checkout main  # ONLY for emergencies

# Safe development workflow
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push origin feature/safe/profile-upload

# When ready for production
git checkout develop
git merge feature/safe/profile-upload
git checkout main
git merge develop
git push origin main  # Triggers production deploy
```

## ⚠️ Production Protection Rules

1. **Never test risky features on production**
2. **Always use feature branches for new development**
3. **Test locally before deploying**
4. **Have rollback plan ready**
5. **Monitor deployments closely**
6. **Keep production stable at all costs**
